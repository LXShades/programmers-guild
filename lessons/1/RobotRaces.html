      Fasten your seatbelts for the <b>Robot Races!</b><br />
      In teams of 3-4 you will <b>design and build</b> a <b>super-robot</b> in <b>LEGO MINDSTORMS</b> that will <b>race</b> against the others in a <b>3-lap loop</b> around the game studio.<br />
      During the race, robots <b>must pass several marked checkpoints</b> along the path to be considered eligible for the next lap, with some leniency.<br />
      <b>The race commences in Session [x]!</b>
  </p>

  <b>Learning Objectives:</b>

  <ul>
      <li><b>Plan</b> a remote-controlled robot, with an aptitude for <b>moving supah-fast</b> and optionally <b>weapon(s) to obstruct other racers</b></li>
      <li>Use the <b>agile development philosophy</b> to build and program the robot components within your group</li>
      <li>Be the <b>very best</b> like <b>no-one ever was</b></li>
  </ul>

  <b>Agenda:</b>

  <b>Further Guidance:</b><br />

  <ul>
      <li><b>Plan</b> a remote-controlled robot, with an aptitude for <b>moving supah-fast</b> with optional <b>weapon(s) to obstruct other racers</b></li>
      <li>Use <b>Trello</b> or a similar management technique to organise necessary component-building and programming tasks.</li>
      <li>Using the <b>agile development philosophy</b>, begin iteratively building and programming the robot components within your group</li>
      <li>Ensure the robot is programmed to be <b>user-controllable</b> from a distance</li>
      <li>Have a <b>human race</b> or maybe an <b>epic rock-paper scissors battle</b> to <b>decide who drives the robot</b> (or pehaps decide in session [x], such that you can build the robot before potentially being in a <b>passive aggressive war</b> with each other, rather than after)</li>
      <li>Prepare to <b>race the robots</b> along a pre-set track by session [x].</li>
  </ul> 
  
  <br />
  <b>Further Learning:</b><br />

  <ul>
      <li>Read <b><a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/best-top-robot-wars-robots-2939336">7 Coolest Robot Wars robots by Joe Roberts</a></b> for inspiration in gratuitous robotic violence</li>
      <li>Watch <a href="http://www.tv.com/shows/wacky-races/watch/">Wacky Races</a> for a long, long list of traps and weapons that <b>probably won't work</b>, courtesy of Dick Dastardly</li>
      <li>Engage in the passive viewing of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=meow">cat videos</a> to relax and calm down after a stressful day of robot building</a></li>
  </ul>
